Asymptotic notation (like Big O) helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is as the input size grows. 
It tells us how fast an algorithm runs or how much memory it uses, especially for large inputs. 
The most common notations are:
Best Case: Fastest scenario
Average Case: Expected scenario
Worst Case: Slowest scenario

we are comparing two algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search.


Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) – when the element is at the beginning.
Average Case: O(n) – on average, half the list is checked.
Worst Case: O(n) – when the element is at the end or not present.

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) – when the element is exactly in the middle.
Average Case: O(log n) – search space is halved each time.
Worst Case: O(log n) – keeps halving until one element remains.

Binary search is significantly faster than linear search, especially for large lists. 
However, binary search requires the list to be sorted in advance. If data is not sorted and cannot be sorted efficiently, linear search is a safer choice, although slower.

In an e-commerce platform, where search is a key feature, we should prefer binary search or even better advanced search algorithms or indexing structures like Hash Maps or Trees, depending on the scale and nature of data.
